# Operations and Loops

## Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal ('='), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, 'x = f()' is an assignment expression that assigns the value of 'f()' to' x.'

**There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand for the operations :**



## **Comparison Operators **

`== `  (equal)

`!==` (not equal)

`===` (strict equal)

`!==` (strict not equal)

 ` > ` (greater than)
 
` >= ` (greater than or equal)

` < ` (less than)

` <= `(less than or equal)


For StatementLinks to an external site.
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false

The Structure of a for loop looks like:

for( initial value; condition to evaluate; increment) { code to execute }

the initial value usually initializes one or more loops counters
if condition to evaluate is true, then the loops statements execute
While StatementLinks to an external site.
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true

The Structure for a while loops looks like:

while ( condition to evaluate is true ){ execute this code }

the loop stop executing if the condition becomes false

## Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal ('='), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, 'x = f()' is an assignment expression that assigns the value of 'f()' to' x.'

**There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand for the operations :**

Name	          Shorthand operator         Meaning
Assignment    	  x = f()                   	x = f()
Addition assignment	x += f()	x = x + f()
Subtraction assignment	x -= f()	x = x - f()
Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	x = x * f()
Division assignment	x /= f()	x = x / f()
Remainder assignment	x %= f()	x = x % f()
Exponentiation assignment	x **= f()	x = x ** f()
Left shift assignment	x <<= f()	x = x << f()
Right shift assignment	x >>= f()	x = x >> f()
Unsigned right shift assignment	x >>>= f()	x = x >>> f()
Bitwise AND assignment	x &= f()	x = x & f()
Bitwise XOR assignment	x ^= f()	x = x ^ f()
Bitwise OR assignment	x |= f()	x = x | f()
Logical AND assignment	x &&= f()	x && (x = f())
Logical OR assignment	x ||= f()	x || (x = f())
Logical nullish assignment	x ??= f()	x ?? (x = f())

Comparison OperatorsLinks to an external site.
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

Comparison operators are:

`== `  (equal)

`!==` (not equal)

`===` (strict equal)

`!==` (strict not equal)

 ` > ` (greater than)
 
` >= ` (greater than or equal)

` < ` (less than)

` <= `(less than or equal)


For StatementLinks to an external site.
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false

The Structure of a for loop looks like:

for( initial value; condition to evaluate; increment) { code to execute }

the initial value usually initializes one or more loops counters
if condition to evaluate is true, then the loops statements execute
While StatementLinks to an external site.
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true

The Structure for a while loops looks like:

while ( condition to evaluate is true ){ execute this code }

the loop stop executing if the condition becomes false

### _About me_:
Hello, I'm Nes . Iâ€™m currently a stay at home mom but have always been fascinated by the world of software and coding. Although I received my degree in Public Administration and Politics, and have worked in various jobs in the past, now I'm here to learn more! English may be my second language but I am determined and very excited to start a career where my son can see me as a role model and become interested. 


**_Growth mindset_** means that you face with a challenge, focusing your abilities to accomplish and not your weaknesses, because possitive thoughts and believes about your abilities `effect the result`.   

### _Growth Mindset Reminders For Myself_ : 
1. No one is good at it when just beginning! 
2. I'm not good at it just **_yet_** !
3. It meant to be hard ! It's a boot camp! Remember No pain no gain ! 
4. Be patient, be persistent! 
5. Do not shy! you're not a kid, you have a kid :)

#### Control flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

**Control flow means** that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

## JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" calls it.

Exp: // Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}






**Types of JavaScript Operators

* Aritmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Conditional Operators
* Type Operators



**Some of the JavaScript Operators**

1. ( ` +	` ) Addition    ` 6 + 9;`  or  `'Hello ' + 'world!';`

2. ( ` -	`) Subtraction   `9 - 3;`    `8 * 2;`  
 
3- ( ` *	`) Multiplication   `8 * 2;`

4- ( `**	`) Exponentiation (ES2016) (Kuvvetini alma)

5- (` /	`)  Division `8/2;`

6- ( `%	`)  Modulus (Division Remainder) 

7- ( `++ `)	Increment

8- (  `--`	) Decrement

9- ( `===` ) Strict equality  This performs a test to see if two values are equal. **It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.**

10- ( = ) It's just for assigning the value  x = Atlas ( doesnt mean equal' we're just assigning value)

11- ( == ) Means 'Equal to' 

`let myVariable = 3; myVariable === 4;`  


### Conditionals

Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. 
A very common form of conditionals is the `if...else statement`. For example:

`let iceCream = "chocolate";`
`
if (iceCream === "chocolate") {`
`
  alert("Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!");
} else {`
`
  alert("Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite…");
}`

The expression inside the `if ()` is the test. This uses the strict equality operator (as described above) to compare the variable `iceCream` with the string `chocolate` to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns `true`, the first block of code runs. `If` the comparison is `not true`, the second block of code—after the `else` statement—runs instead.

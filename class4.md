# Structure web pages with HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation.

When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code. Wireframing is the process of planning and mapping out the design of a website or an app. It is typically hand-drawn sketch via pen and paper or online tools so that is is easy to change and rework. It should be clear and simple as it is the visual guide to the framework and navigation of your website.

For designing web page use ***Wireframe*** programs.

 ### HTML Basics
 
 
 **content** What we want to be seen in te web side as a text.
 **element** An element consists of an opening tag, a closing tag, the content, and the element itself.
 
 Elements can also have **attributes**. Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. 
 
 An attribute should always have the following:

* A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
* The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
* The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
 
 **Empty elements** have no content, such as the img tag , no content.
 
**Nesting elements** when you put elements inside elements. This can be used to emphasize a certain word or phrase. Make sure to properly clsoe the tag inside the element.
 Exp: We only emphasized 1 word with nesting element.

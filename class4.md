# Structure web pages with HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation.

When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code.

For designing web page use ***Wireframe*** programs. Some of them;

 ### HTML Basics
 
 **<p> This is my **paragraph** </p>**
 
 content = This is my paragraph 
 element =  <p> This is my paragraph </p>
 
 Elements can also have **attributes**. Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. 
 
 **<p class="editor note"> This is my paragraph </p>**

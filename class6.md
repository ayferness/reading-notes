### Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

## What is Java Script
Java Script is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, etc.

**For starting:** Go to your test site and create a new folder named **scripts**. Within the scripts folder, create a new text document called **main.js**, and save it. In your **index.html** file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing </body> tag:
`<script src="scripts/main.js"></script>`   (That means we linked js to html file)

##### New Vocabulary
* JavaScript
* conditionals
* operators
* data types
* variable

\

##### **Variables** are contaniers for storing data.There are 4 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:
 
 var x = 5; var y = 6; var z = x + y;   (  **var** = Used in older JS code )
 
let x = 5; var y = 6; var z = x + y;   ( **let** = Use it if value of variable can be changed  )

const x = 5; var y = 6; var z = x + y;   ( **const** = Use it value of variable cannot be changed )

const x = 5; var y = 6; var z = x + y;    ( **nothing** = Mostly used in Python )




###  Basic Functions

#  Design web pages with CSS
##What is CSS 
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
When "font" tags like , and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

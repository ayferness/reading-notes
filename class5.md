#  Design web pages with CSS
## What is CSS  (Cascading Style Sheets) 
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
When "font" tags like , and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
### How To Add CSS?
There are three ways:
1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS

1. External CSS : An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension. exp: "mystyle.css"

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

*Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.*

## "Choosing a Text Editor"
#### What is a text editor?
  A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to *write and manage text*, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

#### What are the options?
Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
Although there are many more option that we can consider. 

#### Third-Party Options
* 'NotePad++'
NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only.
NotePad++ has been around for many years and many web
developers swear by NotePad++. It has syntax highlighting and code
completion, as well as word completion and function completion. It
has a zoom in an out feature, it’s own online community, and its own
chat room for questions that may arise. It even has its own searchable
wiki page for more assistance.

#### TextWrangler/BB Edit
TextWrangler is for Mac computers only, and you used to be able to
download it from the Mac App Store. In doing my research for this
blog post, I’ve come to find out that TextWrangler has been retired. I
know, I’m a little late to the party with this news, but TextWrangler
was retired in 2017. This was one of the go-to text editors for Mac
Computers.
But all hope is not lost, the folks that make TextWrangler, Bare Bones
Software has incorporated TextWrangler into its more robust, big
brother, BB Edit—another feature packed text editor

#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the
web developing community.

#### Atom
Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows
computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. Atom is brought to
you by the folks at GitHub . GitHub is a great service online where
you can host and review code, or you can post and get help with the
development of your own projects. Atom also ticks all the right boxes.
It has syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, the works! Atom is
definitely a software to check out and test drive for yourself.

#### Brackets
Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for
Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. It’s made
and maintained by the good folks at Adobe—yep, the Photoshop
people. Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though
more coding capabilities can be added through extensions. Being that
Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this might be a
great choice to start with. 

#### Sublime Text
Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full
for $70. Otherwise you’ll use the free version. Sublime Text enjoys a
history of being fast and responsive while being extensible as well.
There’s no doubt that Sublime Text will tick the check boxes of what
to look for in a text editor. It has syntax highlighting, it has code
completion, it has themes and extensions. And will definitely get the
job done no matter how advanced you get with your coding.

#### The Difference Between Text
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
software package.
